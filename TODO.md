# TODO

1. Train segment model
 - done

2. Run segment inference
 - add segment inference to scripts
 - run from cell in mario notebook

2. Create behavior tree for apply user generated constraints

3. Create progressive perceptive field and occupancy detection for agent

4. Create tokens and transformer for actions

5. Implement DQN for filtering action tokens

6. Create method for discovering motifs
 - get vertical position of mario on screen, feed into matrixprofile method for action classification (STAMP, STOMP, SCRIMP+, ???), see if forward/backward move commands can be added as another dimension

7. Build system for training new DNNs on sequence clusters

8. Build system for generating new tokens and retraining transformer

9. Evaluation method for deterritorializing bad tokens
