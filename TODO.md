# TODO

1. Train segment model to sematically segment frames
 - notebook works, organize segmentation methods into class

2. Create behavior tree for apply user generated constraints

3. Create progressive perceptive field and occupancy detection for agent

4. Create tokens and transformer for actions

5. Implement DQN for filtering action tokens

6. Create method for discovering motifs
 - try getting vertical position of mario on screen, feed into matrixprofile method for action classification (STAMP, STOMP, SCRIMP+, ???)
 - as an alternative, try embedding the button presses as tokens and try a deep learning method to classify sequences (1D convolution?)???

7. Build system for training new DNNs on sequence clusters

8. Build system for generating new tokens and retraining transformer

9. Evaluation method for deterritorializing bad tokens
