I need to implement sensor fusion node in ROS2 in Python.
Key requirements:
1. The script should use rclpy to subscribe to a optical flow feature tracks topic.
2. The script should use rcly to subscribe to an Imu topic.
3. The script should use sensor fusion to calculate a PoseStamped message.
4. The script should be able to handle sensor drift and noise.
5. The script should be able to recover from sensor failures.
6. The script should be able to operate in both indoor and outdoor environments.
7. The script should be able to operate at a rate of 10 Hz or higher.
8. The script should be able to handle multiple sensors simultaneously.
9. The script should be able to handle sensor data with varying time stamps.
10. The script should be able to handle sensor data with missing values.
11. The script should be able to handle sensor data with outliers.
Please consider:
- Error handling
- Edge cases
- Performance optimization
- Best practices for Python and ROS2
Please do not unnecessarily remove any comments or code.
Generate the code with clear comments explaining the logic.
